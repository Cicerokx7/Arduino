Pschology

day 1:
	Theory:
		set of statements that explain and predict behavior
	Hypotheis:
		prediction that proposes a relationships between vars
	Operational definition = precise description
	Replication = reproduction of results
	Descriptive Methods:
		Goals = describe a phenominon:
			observation
			survays and
		describes does not explain
		naturalistic observation:
			describes does not explain
			Secretly observing
			used more for general phenominons
		Case-Studies:
			very detailed
			knowingly observed
			used more for extreme phenominons
		Surveys:
			usually self report
		Psychology's Scientific Method:
			measures two or more vars
			measures in a direction of either more or less
			(pic 1)
			correlation:
				does not mean that it is the cause
				it is necesary for the cause
day2:
	myelin insilator for neurons makes it faster
day 3:
	sensation and perception:
		transduce from analog to digital?
		transduction for digital to analog?
			sound waves:
				middle ear:
					ossicles = (hammer, anvil, stirrup) = aplifies the eardrum to cochlea
				inner ear:
					cochlea = snail thing that transuction, filled with fluid and hairs
					semicircular canals = balence sensor, connected to the cochlea
				hearing theories:
					Place Theory of Pitch Perception:
						where the vibrations in the cochlea is what determines what is heard
						true for higher frequency
					Frequency Theory of Pitch Perception:
						says the frequency if what determines what is heard
						true for lower frequency
				localizing sound = identifies where the sound is
			boudy senses:
				touch
				temperature
				pain
				haptic(shape)
				propioception(where the limbs are)
				vesibular sys(balance)
			chemical senses:
				olfaction = smell
				gustation = taste also includes smell
day 4:
	senses:
		taste:
			(sweet(pleasant), sour(if(mild):pleasant; if(strong):not pleasant), salty(pleasant), bitter(not pleasant), umami(pleasant)) and likely more
		flavor:
			includes taste and all the other senses

Chptr 7:

	memory:
		this = learning that persists over time
		encoding:
			this = input
			automatic(implicit memories):
				uses hind brain stuff
				implicit memories:
					self = memories without conscious recall
			effortful(explicit memories):
				uses higher level parts of the brain
				selective attention:
					
				divided attention:
					
				sustained attention:
				shallow:
					physical traits
				intermedieate:
					category label
				deep:
					personalised
				elaboration:
					visual imagery:
						dual-code hypothesis(paivio):
							verbal code = words needed
							image code = detailed image
					knowledge base
					spacing effect = how long things are spread out:
						distrubuted practice
						massed practice = cramming
		storage:
			this = maintenance
			Atkinson-Shiffrin Model(older idea?):
				sensory memory = exact copy of incoming information lasting for a fraction of a second-couple of seconds
				short-term memory
				long-term memory
		retrieval:
			this = output

3/1/22:
	learning:
		permanent change brought by repeated dexperience
		can't be explained by innate or instinct or maturing
		behaviorism:
			learing should be a science
			learning should be studied based on behaviors
			Ivan Pavlov:
			John B Watson:
			Associative learning:
				learning that certain events occur together
				more implicit
				C = conditioned
				U = Unconditioned
				S = stimulus
				R = response
				N = nutrual
				classical conditioning:
					emotion shifts a non-meaningful stimulus to a meaningful stimulus
					no control over
					always stimulus then response
					association between CS and US
					Ivan Pavlov(started this stuff)
					NS => no R
					US => US
					NS+US => US
					NS => CS
					CS => CR
					very helpful for primative survival
					acquisition = paring (exponential +)
					extinction = unpairing (exponetial -)
					after extinction when a brake is given the stimulus is repaired, but not as significant as the first pairing
					discrimination = the learned ability to distingish CS and NS
					Watson (Little Albert Study):
						unethical
						taught to fear white rats
						after he feared all animals and a white mask
						this is generalization
						shows how one S can cause multiple R
				Operant Conditioning:
					simular to clasical conditioning except more explicit
					always response then stimulus
					B.F. Skinner:
						cat learned to escape by trial and error
						if the cat was rewarded after its escape it remembered it more
						this is called shaping
					positive is when something positive is added
					negative is when something negative is added, such as a seatbelt beeping thing
					primary reinforcer is primative biological need
					secondary reinforcer is simular to money
					punishment:
						positive = adds an undesirable element
						negative = removes a positive element:
							fine would be a negative punishement
						behavior is supressed but not forgotten
						it teaches discrimination amoung situations
						punishment can teach fear of teacher
						physical punishment can increase agression
						best changes in permformance include telling what to do and what not to do
					learned helplessness = you know it, it's self explanitory
					shaping:
						desired behavior taught that is not in the person/organism's
						complex problems are broken into smaller pieces and strung together in a chain
			Cognitive learning:
				more explicit
				observational learninng:

	CHPTR 9 Developmental:
		Biological Processes:
				nature and nurture:
					nature = biology, heredity
					nurture = enviroment,
					work together, however one can be more promoment
					Dynamic System Theory:
						perpetual ongoing process molded by a complex network of biological, psychological, and social factors
						each time period is equally important
						resilience:
							a person's ability to adapt and recover
						resilient children become capable adults
				three different processes
				prenatal development:
					three periods of natal development:
						zygote(conception):
							from conception to the time that it is implanted into the uteran wall
							will begin to develop different layers
							0-2 weeks
							no blood or anything being exchanged
							drinking, smoking, drugs do not have an effect during this stage
							lowest 8-9 days
							high end is 2 weeks
						embryo(fertilization):
							starts at implantation
							3-8
							lots happening, brain and heart are developing
							most problems occur here
							central nervous system occurs at the begining of this system
							noticible brain by week 9
							most dangerious time to be drinking, smoking, or doing drugs
						fetus:
							9-38/40 weeks
							longest time development
							age of viability is 14 weeks before full term!
							7 months in the baby is able to learn languages while in the  womb
						critical and sensitive periods:
							critical periods:
								when if something is missed it cannot be redone
				prental environmental inlfuences:
					teratogen:
						any disease, drug, or other environmental ageent that can cause harm to developing babies
						not always harmful
						problems can be missed in animal testing
						alcohaul is one of the most dangerous
					nutritian:
						can be significant, even early on
						iodine is important for brain development
					stress:
					age:
						after 35 there can be problems for women 20s can be the best age
						there can only be problems from men at very old age
				newborn reflexes:
					absense of presence of reflex fives information about the baby's brain and development
					rooting reflex:
						helps the baby with feeding
					palmar reflex:
						grasping
					moro reflex:
						thrusts arms and legs out and arches back
					stepping:
						mimics motion walking
					?:
						toes flex when foot is stroked
					research brain development stuff
				brain age:
					20-90:
						5-10%
						bain begins to shrink
						aerobic fitness can grow the hippocampus and decrease brain loss
				
			Cognitive Processes:
				Piaget:
					thought things were in stages(wrong)
					birth-2:
						infant experience through movement and senses development and senses develops schemas, begins to act intelligently
						sensing and exploring the world
						underestimated the the ability of infants
					2-6:
						
					#research missed alot
				
			Sociomotional Processes:
3/10/22:
	CHPRT 9:
		Biological processes:
			Cognititve Processes:
				Piaget:
					Conservation tasks:
						the awareness that altering something does not change the fundemental elements
						2-6 years old ususally fail
						7-11  years old it is recognized from 7-11
						one of his errors was that cognition is rooted in action, in reality some are naturally born with
					one of his errors was that from 12< he thought they would be able to do extremely inteligent thinking(it can error by education and culture)
					one of his errors he thought that infants were less inteligent than they were(some things are starting to be seen earlier than we were
					violation of expectation:
						testing infants with an impossible event and a possible event to test their reaction
						developed by Rene Baleragion?
						3-5.5 month old babies were supriesed by impossible events
						piaget's tasks were more explicit which was more of a cause for error
						this was more implicit
						natavist appraoch:
							domain specific knowledge applies to a single topic
						wynn:
							at 6 months the baby can add and subtract
							in the study the babies might have only been looking the edges of the toys and notice that difference(doesn't seem likely
				Viygotsky:
					says that complex mental activities have there roots in social interaction
					thought that some capabilities can be created through the language(such as the word for color)
					came before piaget but the research came out after Piaget
					in some ways his work was less detailed than Piaget due to the cultural differents
				crossectional research:
					is when we research any random age
				longitudinal:
					is when we follow the same group over a course of time
				cognitive time of decline peeks at 50 and slowly decline(for longitudinal)(likely accurate)
				cognitive time of decline peeks at 40 and quickly declines(for crossectionally)(likely false)
				40-60s is the prime intilectual time
				fluid:
					declines from 20s on
					skills working memory, analytical speed, detecting relationship amoung stimuli
				crystallized:
					incressed knowledge, experience, judgement, social conventions
					serious decline begins in 80s
		Human development:
			temperment:
				characteristic ways of responding
				thomas and chess theory:
					easy kids = quickly establish routines, are happy, and adapt
					difficult childrent = oposite
					slow to warm up kids = mild low reaction adjusts slowly to new experiences
					35% kids did not fit into any of these categories
				new theory:
					extraversion/surgency:
						approach, pleasure, activity, smiling, and laughter
					negative affectivity:
						frear, frustration, sadness, and discomfort, easily distressed
					effortful control:
						self-regulation, attentional focusing and shifting, inhibitoy control, percetual sensitivity, and low-intensity pleasure
						self regulation is linked to school readiness
					attachment theory:
						the close emotional bond between an infant and its caregiver;
							may provude important foundation for subsiquent
							?
						Harlow's Monkeys:
							the two cloth and feeding mothers, where the baby monkey grew more attatched to the cloth mother
							Blowlby's ethological theory of attachment:
								innate signals
								?
								Mary Ainsworth:
									strange stituation
									?
									secure attachment:
										used the relation with the parent to explore, didn't react badly when parent left
									avoidant attachment:
										avioded the parents
									resistant attacchment:
										ident

	CHPTR 9:
		Bilogical processes:
			temperment:
				new theory:
					attachment theory:
						Harlow's Monkeys:
							Blowlby's ethological theory of attachment:
								Mary Ainsworth:
						Secure:
							Leaders, sensitive to others, popular with peers, initiated 
						Insecure:
							Socially withdrawn, hesitant, less willing to learn, less curious
				parenting:
					Authoritative:
						best outcome
						high in control
						acceptence
						control can very depending on situation
						autonomy is appropriate
						results:
							higher self esteem and accedemic output
					Authoritarian:
						acceptence is low
						high control
						either high or low involcement
						high control
						low autonomy
						results:
							low confidence, and stress
					permisive:
						spoiler
						acceptence high
						involvement is either too high or too low
						results:
							spoiled brat
					uninvolved:
						self explanitory
						results:
							most negative outcomes
							low confidence
							at risk of becoming a drug addict
				identity:
					not seen until adolecences
					identity achievement:
						after research then committed to the identity
					identity moratorium:
						exploring without a commitiment
						this a very healthy part
					it can be very healthy to chose between these too
					the top two are the best
					identity foreclosure:
						commitment without research
						unhealthy
					identity diffusion:
						no exploration and no commitment
						worst one
					ethnic identity:
						attachment to an your own ethnic group
						attachment to a culture
						can be more than one culture
					parents can effect identity
					the effect of peers and parents on an idedentity is in a perpandicular relationship
					romantic partners increase
					emerging adulthood:
						trasnition between adolencence to adulthood
						only availible in first world places
						charactoristics:
							identity exploration
							instability
							self-focus
							feeling "in between"
							age of possibilities
							#your position
	CHPTR 10:
			gender:
				identity
				cisgeneder = what you believe
			Gender Schema:
				culture defines gender
				gender stereotype:
					#self explanitory
					#sexist stuff
					cultural myths:
						Maccoby and Jacklin:
						sais that there aren't real difference based on the gender stereotypes
						#they showed the stupid Gillet add, so that should help to explain this
						Nomaidic societies don't have as seperate gender roles
						Argricultural societies have more seperate gender roles
						men are now being considered less intelligent
				Social cognitive theory of gender:
					says that kids are influenced for gender in a simular way that bobo doll experiment resulted
				gender schema theory:
					graudually emereges based on the culture and not direct feedback
					androgyny:
						things that are considured more masculine or feminine
						masculine(instrumentality)
						feminine(expressiveness)
						androgyny(both)
						if both scores on the online quiz are above 4 the androgyninous
						higher self esteem
						more likable
						improved coping and adjustment skills
						free to explore stuff
				differences:
					men will outperform women on visiospatial skills(not by much)
					men are more assertive and likely to smile
					boys and men are more indepentent
					men tend to connect perception with action, women tect to improve social relationships
					men prefur to work with things
					testosterone may effect brain development:
						it can increase lateralization, increases right hemisphere, and decreases left hemisphere
					women are better at language
					girls are talked to more than boys at birth
			

			sexual orientation:
				who you sleep with
			sex:
				#you know
				23rd chromosones determine this
				#find the which XY and XX does what
				gonodal homrmones, estrogen, or androgens, can determine the sex
				secondary sex charactoristics does the secondary stage
